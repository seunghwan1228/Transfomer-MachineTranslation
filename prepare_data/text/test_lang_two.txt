then , predictions can be made and tested .
it had forced multiple labs that were offering brca testing to stop .
ants are a classic example workers work for queens and queens work for workers .
one of every hundred children born worldwide has some kind of heart disease .
at this point in her life , she s suffering with full blown aids and had pneumonia .
where are economic networks
applause
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
and yet , the irony is , the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space .
the light never goes out .
now , tweets , who s tweeting
in egypt , for instance , percent of all the females that live in egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way .
on the other hand , month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they could n t figure this out .
in that instant , i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .
and the discussion is , who cares right
if you designate a spot and you re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
it s a very popular museum now , and i created a big monument for the government .
it s completely irrelevant .
they all argued that , my technique is the best , but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
at that moment , i started thinking .
mt so over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon .
beau lotto so , this game is very simple .
so i proposed to rebuild . i raised did fundraising .
what we did betty rapacholi , who was one of my students , and i was actually to give the babies two bowls of food one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
it s something that happens to us without our consent .
we burn with passion .
genital mutilation is horrible and not known by american women , but in some countries , many countries , when a child is born that s a girl , very soon in her life , her genitals are completely cut away by a so called cutter who has a razor blade and , in a non sterilized way , they remove the exterior parts of a woman s genitalia .
that s percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
i met him at a event .
let me show you what i mean .
i think this is a problem .
mt oh , , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday .
as peter levine has said , the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity .
cortisol is toxic , and it causes cloudy thinking .
and sometimes , in more extreme cases but not very rare cases , they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate .
there are always traces no such thing as a perfect crime .
go and look behind the mountains .
adam and oz both saved an hour of time .
of course not ! you ve got to practice .
soon after that , i found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
so i was like , okay , so we ve got the formula ready .
to paraphrase chavez , once social change begins , it can not be reversed .
in this video , we can see how a very tiny catheter takes the coil to the heart .
and by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
they have money and power .
i am not my father .
and that affects all of us .
in this respect , for members of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone s suffering , and to hold the hope for their recovery .
do we know better than them
laughter you re all cfo , astrophysicists , ultra marathoners , it turns out .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the th century .
it is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions .
around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
instead , it requires that you trust your partner and talk about things when trusting feels difficult , which sounds so simple , but is actually a kind of revolutionary , radical act .
the germans , french , japanese and chinese , all these nations are aware of this .
does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues
audience what are you reading
we filed in federal court in the southern district of new york , and the case was randomly assigned to judge robert sweet .
we can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
and they finally agreed .
i found powerpoint much more challenging , but now i use powerpoint all the time .
dave strudwick is she still going up here student yeah .
you render it down . you make a candle , etc . etc .
but what we know today is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes .
right this is simple physics .
now we re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
it was like , do n t mess with me .
the united states has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in oecd .
no open surgery was necessary .
and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
they were a highly cooperative species .
applause
and here i am with a pregnant woman , who is hiv positive and we re smiling , both of us are smiling , because we re very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she s about to give birth to .
there was an enormous energy in the room .
the idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing .
and the other interesting thing is that they re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
and there are other studies to confirm that most relationships begin this way .
in conclusion , what can you do today
that s why they use it in production , they pay a lot of money to develop it .
right the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it , which means we never see what s there , we never see information , we only ever see what was useful to see in the past .
the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
these are both real objects .
these ideas align nicely with our cultural investment in long term romantic commitment , but they also work well for other kinds of relationships short term , casual , polyamorous , non monogamous , asexual because this metaphor brings much more complex ideas to the experience of loving someone .
but they re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
its title . refers to the number of microseconds that the earth s day was shortened .
we were always best in class .
and it s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because i think it s the secret to understanding what s happening in the world .
i just sat there .
one is an acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo erectus .
after that moment of inspiration , there came a very long time of effort developing a prototype .
we saw all kinds of donated equipment .
he had people to prepare his dinner every night .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world .
so i tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure .
so the question is what would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked
we make ourselves small .
creativity is the idea .
this is true .
the introduction says , what s the question and why
this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by .
together with two academic institutions , michael porter at harvard business school , and the karolinska institute in sweden , bcg has formed something we call ichom .
but the good news is , it does n t always last that long usually from a few months to a couple of years .
we ve gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree .
genocide is not only about the killing it is about the denied identity .
this is actually pretty typical of four year olds .
there s an evolutionary reason for this .
applause so when did this habit start
but physicians have another characteristic .
we went back to the drawing board .
so we re going to write this up and try to submit this for publication . right so we have to write it up .
or here .
how did we achieve that
the child who represented it was mocked , ridiculed and bullied endlessly .
they traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs , and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of australia .
one night , my friend malte , were camping in the amazon region .
but i think i felt like it was my job to be miserable , because if i could be miserable , then i would prove how much i loved him .
and that s when we have a conflict .
but what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime
mt yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds .
and of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
it s quite extraordinary what they do .
i ll leave you with this story .
what about travel
they do n t have funding yet , but i dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they re most needed .
but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus
in my practice as a consultant , i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
the problem with questions is they create uncertainty .
rollercoaster , carousel .
the oil was running out , and a nuclear winter would finish us off .
let s start from this moment .
water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather , and growing up in these tough situations , at the age of , i was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter , and we were sunbathing .
well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , i think the best thing is think about cases where we re put in a new situation that we ve never been in before when we fall in love with someone new , or when we re in a new city for the first time .
so , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
i ran through the numbers myself .
in fact , in a number of us states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
the history of western culture is full of language that equates love to mental illness .
we are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
but it s really good for things that do n t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
for many years , swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
it s as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island .
they all have faces .
we swoon .
what are the tools that we re actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow
the acid rain was falling on the forests .
and that is , that people s view of you is frozen in time .
i notice a couple of things about this .
what s the context of this meal
and that was that i hardly kept up with the business news .
because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you would n t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
face to face with a predator , you do n t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you re body is expending metabolism on those things and you do n t react quickly , you might become the lion s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
and we did n t know when we left the hospital because we filmed her story we did n t know if she was going to survive .
now , why are companies embracing the reentry internship
now , i should say that we did n t get funding for this study because the scientists said small children could n t make a useful contribution to science , and the teachers said kids could n t do it .
you do n t want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot .
the point is that we have to have a context , a gauge for our actions in all this .
i call it the dark playground .
two years later , and the deterioration was dramatic .
audience shouts laughter shouts laughter brilliant . now , open your eyes . we ll do it one more time .
then , in taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
i said , read what you re seeing . right
like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
literature has to take us beyond .
what lies within us can never be truly colonized , contorted , or taken away .
but most of them do n t know .
you can have , as it were , asexual culture .
but if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .
there s a part of this problem i think i can solve the part of this problem i have spent my life working on .
we have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
and i ll get to that in a minute .
i have a francophone friend who s married to a french man .
my behavior has always perplexed the non procrastinators around me , and i wanted to explain to the non procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators , and why we are the way we are .
ca so , what was the impact of that
digital mt this is without a question the real thing .
you pop this in .
thank you .
this is one reality .
we did a study where we looked at oecd data .
fast forward four years later , after having written a page business plan on the cell phone , having written my patent on the cell phone , i m the youngest patent holder in the country , and no more bathing ! i ca n t say any more than that . laughter i had invented drybath , the world s first bath substituting lotion .
i think on some level i wanted to feel a little bit crazy , because i thought that that was how loved worked .
finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
ca so they are well motivated .
it s just a quick video of what we do .
and it s children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the aids virus .
after that , we re going to go on a youtube spiral that starts with videos of richard feynman talking about magnets and ends much , much later with us watching interviews with justin bieber s mom .
i am a writer and i m also an english teacher , which means i think about words for a living .
so these are my illusion glasses .
but it s really necessary to do it .
we do n t have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons .
regardless of the who , how and why .
and the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
they had language , probably , because we know they had the foxp gene of the same kind as us , which was discovered here in oxford .
but despite my panic , some small voice in my head thought , wow . that was dramatic .
so for example , voices which threatened to attack my home i learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world , rather than an actual , objective danger .
all right . very significant mark .
creativity is the meme maker that puts slogans on our t shirts and phrases on our lips .
what you guys have done is real , true and amazing .
people forget that . people think of trade as a modern thing .
ja oh , come on . there must be some .
and there s no time to do it .
as you can see in the chart , the frequency of this kind of hole dramatically increases with altitude .
in , in turkey , the big earthquake , i went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
applause
and it s not the doctor s fault , if it s anybody s fault , it s the fault of scientists like me .
this is reverend bayes s notebook .
right if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you re moving . your eyes , because it s moving in register with the boat , say i m standing still .
after the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
they were all working for me , to make a mouse for me .
the next work is an object , that s also a kind of sound instrument .
in johannesburg , i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really do n t quite know what the solutions are .
laughter now . . .
about days before the japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of christchurch , was totally destroyed .
here are a couple more .
mt there are two colors in a deck of cards .
so it s highly that one s the cool one .
taking it a step further , mit s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
what s stopping you applause i m not done yet . i m not done yet .
so we raised this , pound steel ring .
and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue .
that s very rewarding from the medical and human point of view .
hotel . . . bushmaster two six , bushmaster two six ,
and there s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you re confronted with a medical decision to make .
but there s no evidence of a sexual division of labor .
we saw fungus growing on microscope lenses .
there s no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact .
what we have here is one exploit file .
it s kind of an interesting feedback loop .
now we have the good fortune to open up space .
and love involves both joy and pain .
how are they organized are they isolated
there s no evidence of gathering behavior by females .
there are some light sources .
but caution makes you hesitate , and hesitate you re lost , so take your opportunities and never count the cost .
ok , never mind .
so i proposed to the mayor , i d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
that s what science offers us . it offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play , right
the color coordination is very important .
they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue , or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow .
and here things got really interesting .
so babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
i m now very proud to be a part of intervoice , the organizational body of the international hearing voices movement , an initiative inspired by the work of professor marius romme and dr . sandra escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
so if love is a collaborative work of art , then love is an aesthetic experience .
reframing love as something i get to create with someone i admire , rather than something that just happens to me without my control or consent , is empowering .
i saw a returning engineer , a nontraditional reentry candidate , apply for an entry level internship program in the military , and then get a permanent job afterward .
there are million people now living in slavery .
today i m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year olds .
ok , so today i want to talk about how we talk about love .
next challenge , the biennial of the americas in denver asked , could i represent the nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture
that s what we ve achieved as a species .
for us at global witness , this is a moment for change .
and part of the albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
there s spring , summer , autumn and a voice my favorite season is winter . mt well yeah , mine too .
i m going to share with you the story as to how i have become an hiv aids campaigner .
to close the hole , major surgery used to be the only solution .
we get it in the abstract .
so let s take an example , actually .
or here i am in the kitchen .
so they re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that s important .
i want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this to making objects like this .
you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
dangerous troublemaker .
there s no working for each other across the colonies .
i asked the kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which does n t go with the color of the paper tubes .
there was no progress , no innovation .
now , i had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people .
i m performing for you .
a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel is n t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
applause so , what have we done to protect the arabic language
applause
but the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .
the coil then closes the hole .
you can not oppress the people who are not afraid anymore .
if you had to start from scratch , let s say you go out into the countryside .
and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
so we have to start a foundation with a one to one model .
laughter and that would happen every single paper .
let me mention just one that we did with tumar kushner , my student .
and so both sides raise each other s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
and then , year afterward , , in kobe , japan , we had a big earthquake .
now , at first , this was very difficult to believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing , so in this respect , a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from what i d previously interpreted to be a literal truth .
now , at global witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice .
we re the neurons in this brain .
my body s an accumulation of ideas too the idea of skin cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of liver cells .
so we go , of course , to the pub . all right laughter the one on the left is mine , okay laughter now , i tell them , a paper has four different sections an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
in all hunter gatherer societies today , there s a foraging division of labor between , on the whole , hunting males and gathering females .
so what i would like to do is , if we could dim the lights , please , it turns out foldscopes are also projection microscopes .
so how can we ever do anything new well fortunately , evolution has given us an answer , right
so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
he lives entirely in the present moment .
lifespan is up by percent in my lifetime .
someone more adventurous than me might have seen this as a moment of opportunity , but i just froze .
that s a huge difference , a seven fold difference .
many of the people want to stay here forever .
i never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture .
so long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade , not migration .
so , this is two minutes .
so what s it like to be a baby
timing accounted for percent of the difference between success and failure .
he told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
i would like to kind of zoom in on the moon .
those are invisible .
so i tried bronze casting .
they re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they re all ready to serve you at an hour s notice with an excellent meal that s probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had .
i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america s cup racing yachts named peter heppel .
the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues i met , former friends from medical school , who i knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people i d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
so there is some evidence that love is associated with changes to our moods and our behaviors .
continuous improvement .
it made us feel that she s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he wo n t understand , and he s right not to his way of thinking is different .
but real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
these are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found , .
this is in the scottish parliament .
i mean this quite seriously .
in three years time , we plan to have covered percent of the disease burden .
nobody , literally nobody .
the sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .
applause let s get rid of this cultural cringe . applause
is n t it extraordinary
and the reason for that is because there s a reproductive division of labor .
and once again , in edinburgh with the wonderful african children s choir who i simply adore .
boy oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
we did n t say , no ! we do not accept this or that . we did n t adopt this style because that way , we would n t be understood .
even though many people told me , why do you bother
now you re probably thinking , well , ok , one in chance of lowering my cholesterol .
now , science and asking questions is about courage .
the odds of getting it are , to one .
all the ones in bold are eight to years old .
it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me .
bob s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
so what does that mean
you actually see how the lenses are cut together in the cross section pattern .
and unlike anything else we ve just seen , virtual or not . voice signed card detected .
it s a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .
the woman knows that , in the hadzas case here digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat .
, much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , i just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
ag every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
it s a unique human feature .
we need business leaders to stand up and say , secrecy like this is not good for business .
i looked around , and there was no one there , but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable .
i tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break .
and once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
we can visualize the future .
a foldscope is a completely functional microscope , a platform for fluorescence , bright field , polarization , projection , all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper .
a few years ago , i broke into my own house .
so that is why i started working in disaster areas .
it s for the number needed to treat .
oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe .
so , this is an example no one can argue with .
we re not trying to find ourselves at an employer s expense .
if we were more assertive , more open minded , more generous and instead of falling in love , we stepped into love .
so , amy
we call this value based healthcare .
that s a sevenfold increase .
that s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
i spent some time telling the college g . p .
it s a grassroots campaign with percent membership being women , most of whom are hiv positive .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
but today we re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we re gone .
our thinking is backwards .
i had been tracking return to work programs since , and in , i started noticing the use of a short term paid work opportunity , whether it was called an internship or not , but an internship like experience , as a way for professionals to return to work .
the process took nearly eight years from the start to finish , with many twists and turns along the way .
now , you do get other animals working for each other too .
another example , one of my favorite insects , i love to hate this one , is a mosquito , and you re seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens .
and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones did n t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
can we measure it better than we do
it s actually a way of being , which is here , and this is true for anything that is creative .
other times , of course , now , we have drones that attack people and so forth .
well , you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals , who quarried for stone axes at a place called mount isa , which was a quarry owned by the kalkadoon tribe .
none of those things happened , laughter and astonishingly , if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime , the average per capita income of the average person on the planet , in real terms , adjusted for inflation , has tripled .
joker presenting my pogo stick . mt ah . watch out .
after that , we launched another campaign with scenes of letters on the ground .
there s one more thing i remember vividly from my own career break .
during the four years of conflict that devastated the bosnian nation in the early s , approximately , citizens , mainly civilians , went missing , presumed killed , and another , were killed during combat operations .
these are difficult questions , but i have some theories .
however , some of the facility authority does n t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it s become more difficult to control them .
applause
but we have another more important reality that we ought to think about .
just for malaria itself , there are a million deaths a year , and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malarial infections .
here s my brain .
she is opening the door .
a broken and haunted person began that journey , but the person who emerged was a survivor and would ultimately grow into the person i was destined to be .
now , i think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works .
the family was relieved .
he does n t need adam .
how would you feel
so in order to argue that what myriad did was not an invention , and that isolated brca genes were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , like what s a gene what s dna
all right , we are n t from the developed world , this advanced thinking has n t reached us yet , and we would like to catch up with the civilized world .
while i can no longer remember what that argument was about , i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave .
we are very cool !
the other is obviously a computer mouse .
my background is in finance , and i hardly kept up with any news when i was home caring for my four young children .
everyone in the world respects nelson mandela , everyone reveres nelson mandela .
laughter ag now this is his next idea .
she is going to a lecture .
so we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making drybath available .
and crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
a third time , it s just being a technician .
oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this does n t have electricity .
now she is the personification of courage , because she s going to stand up here and talk to you all .
fourteen years ago , i first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries .
i would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then i would kind of do this .
in fact , you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body .
laughter applause thank you . i had one big problem .
it s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it s true .
we lost the fear of creating something new .
what it allows you to do is see tiny little lifeforms that are invisible to the naked eye .
they ve come together .
and the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
it s not just about a particular senior politician who s been caught up in a scandal .
and why do we talk about this ostensibly good experience as if we are victims
you have to close your eyes , and you have to point where you hear me clapping . all right
i m also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world , the first african to get that accolade , and one thing that really puzzles me is , i did all of this just because i did n t want to bathe . thank you .
in , in sri lanka , after the sumatra earthquake and tsunami , i rebuilt islamic fishermen s villages .
the one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
in november of , i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela s foundation that is his hiv aids foundation .
the year is .
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
as a cyber magician , i combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced .
they argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world , and that they can even act as a guide for future actions , like self fulfilling prophecies .
so , in love , we fall .
a curious little invention is being talked about .
the object on the right is made from a confection of different substances , from silicon and metal and plastic and so on .
applause thank you . applause thank you very much . applause
two tribes , hutu and tutsi , fought each other .
and then you ask , why economists
it s one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic .
i believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce , and here s why .
i m going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in .
i believe that eleanor can get through this .
so we packaged drybath in these innovative little sachets .
these were the men i looked up to .
nowadays , . people per , are in prison .
and in , in chengdu , sichuan area in china , nearly , people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in risk .
i was working at the aclu as the organization s science advisor .
so the gains from trade are only going to grow .
i think as machines ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it s going to become possible to analyze an entire life s worth of content the tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts that we re producing in such massive numbers .
can i do it on you laughter oh yeah , yeah , yeah , come on . yeah yeah . okay .
this is the real madness , because there is no cosmic rule that says that great suffering equals great reward , but we talk about love as if this is true .
and this is one of the beauties of exchange , is it actually creates the momentum for more specialization , which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on .
over the last couple of years , we ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership .
homo erectus made the same tool for , generations .
back in , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
we ve started collecting data for malaria , chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves .
so i was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
now , successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field .
oh , we should measure this . no , we should measure that .
and sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
they bring out the issues of stigma .
and the voice persisted , days and then weeks of it , on and on , narrating everything i did in the third person .
, in west india , i built also a shelter .
lost and waiting for you . go ! in the coming years , i became a medical student .
we re smarter , we re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
they made his silly outfits , like this , laughter and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
well it turns out that the babies , the new caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
in the military , they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place .
now , patent cases tend to be company a sues company b over some really narrow , obscure technical issue .
so you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
it s a big part of the national budgets .
that would be the first time where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given place .
death adam
now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years , it seems to me now as if someone died in that place , and yet , someone else was saved .
and you also want to think about things like quality of life .
i m going to show you my other favorite feature .
we need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy .
for community though , we start at the very beginning .
a few weeks after the court issued its decision , i received a small package in the mail .
i think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate .
there is an xy stage , and then there is a focusing stage , which is a flexure mechanism that s built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps .
they ve all been combined together in this technology .
and often , the data actually does n t exist .
now i found this principle really exciting .
and there , it was reviewed by five independent referees , and it was published . okay applause applause it took four months to do the science , two years to get it published . laughter typical science , actually , right so this makes amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world .
love is powerful and at times painful , and we express this in our words and stories , but then our words and stories prime us to expect love to be powerful and painful .
we all know little bits , but none of us knows the whole .
in other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore do n t reach patients .
and that s primarily because scalability of the diagnostics is completely out of reach .
they were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
five years ago , i was on a sabbatical , and i returned to the medical university where i studied .
in several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
it s forever freely accessible by biology letters .
in effect , a vicious cycle of fear , avoidance , mistrust and misunderstanding had been established , and this was a battle in which i felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation .
because you ve got to include the man who grew the coffee , which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig , who was drilling for oil , which was going to be made into the plastic , etc .
i could n t build this with a steel ring , the way i knew .
ja i m not sure which way it s going to go .
so during the summer with my students , we built over units of the shelters .
i was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook .
i probably should n t say that .
zak ebrahim is not my real name .
well , basically the east was swallowed by the west .
erik , my father in law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
because if you get any product from turkey or elsewhere and it s not labeled in turkish , then it is n t a local product .
we realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want drybath . laughter at least once a week .
the population explosion was unstoppable .
and using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
now the question is how could we ask them
okay . laughter
i was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
i was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as i d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , she is leaving the room .
they have education programs .
because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom up world that we ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
now to be clear , i m a journalist and not a technologist , so what i d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
so , i would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the millennium development goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world especially in sub saharan africa could you please stand up .
in the book of exodus alone , there are references to smiting , which is the word that the bible uses for the vengeance of an angry god .
and johnson and lakoff talk about everything that collaborating on a work of art entails effort , compromise , patience , shared goals .
all you have to do is read what you see . right
as you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
and what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting attending zombie back home .
so we set out to build our case .
they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing because the population of about , people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the technology they had .
in other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in .
he said , here it is . i m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them .
the path , it s not easy .
ao who is this
we re just the nodes in the network .
i ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years i went to about different countries .
trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye . multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind .
i d done well at school . expectations for me were high , and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
and sure enough , the four year olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports .
bl amazing . what about this one one , two , three . audience you are not reading this .
they begin with a question .
so you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
i m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i m really going to get to the cracks .
joker whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! music mt but today , i am performing for a different kind of audience .
laughter right it s getting information . it s generating behavior that s useful . laughter laughter video man ow ! ow ! laughter applause bl and sometimes , when things do n t go our way , we get a little bit annoyed , right
what s interesting to me is that all of this happens in a culture that values lifelong monogamy .
we re born into a certain family , nation , class .
so we did it anyway . right of course .
and we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors , like gold .
and there are micro optics at the bottom that s actually embedded in the paper itself .
now we need to get this thing into practice .
this fishing village was famous for sculpture .
you literally put it on your skin , and you do n t have to bathe .
why should we care about this
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
they d go back to being consumers , clueless consumers , like we are most of the time .
this is an easy sell .
so this building became a permanent building .
so anytime i talk , you d see it on the screen .
this is a very serious problem . it s ordinarily not addressed .
an attorney in the office who d never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .
so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
and in order to tackle this , we need to change the game .
on one side is a new caledonian crow .
anyway , today i m a writer blogger guy .
and i d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
thank you .
it s fixed in a clenched spasm and it s excruciatingly painful .
falling is accidental , it s uncontrollable .
ao the puzzle we came up with was an if then rule .
so that was the goal of my design .
they actually feel they re going to win even at games of chance .
i m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
and i think as that happens , it s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we re creating and technology s ability to make sense of it all .
but as a natural optimist , i do see that we are starting to get some change .
some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
laughter and it was n t until i got to the airport check in counter , that i realized i did n t have my passport . laughter
i m going to share two directions that are new in my work .
and yes , my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right laughter for me , not for him . right because we ve only done this once before . laughter and you like technology , right
five months ago , i led a workshop at the largest university hospital in northern europe .
child mortality is down by two thirds .
you get them to achieve unbelievable things .
what if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive
you may think that s a sneeze , but it s not a sneeze , it s an acronym .
this is what happened in japan two years ago , in northern japan .
it did n t happen in tierra del fuego similar island , similar people .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to . . .
you know , i was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
it s the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves , is reproduction .
one of them is kiki , one of them is bouba .
sorry ! sigh now , what is going on here
then i built the temporary structure , .
we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape and spent a whole afternoon with her an adorable child .
they all realized they had their individual way of operating .
how does this actually work
when i was in office as governor of georgia , one out of every , americans were in prison .
ag okay , that s a fourth hypothesis .
no , no . the other way .
okay . thank you very much .
like , she can fake it , she can become it .
well what kind of explanation could we have for this
thank you .
they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .
thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist manual sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto , portugal .
now it had a sense of place .
why is that so , that alex in kenya , fatima in bangladesh , navjoot in mumbai , and julie and mary in uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick
you just snap them in half , and you squeeze it out .
the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
the one thing that all of them have in common is that they re going to die .
they re both technologies . in the end , their similarity is not that interesting .
the prime minister of iceland has resigned .
so the idea is that we have this early period when we re completely protected .
first , in a pivotal moment of this case , the us government switched sides .
we d go back to the beginning .
i thought that was the end of everything .
so i would like to show you something i ve been working on .
clapping clapping okay , how about if everyone over there shouts . one , two , three
well , to this , i just say , no no .
at this moment , every one of you is a creative project .
this is a time of need .
compare apples to apples . who s better
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .
i remember well the meals of my childhood .
what s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes
i ve tried to work out which is bigger , and it s almost impossible .
video dave strudwick so what we re going to do student c .
but at this time , giving voice to the catadores .
so i m not completely organized , but i see organization as a gradual process , and i m getting there .
laughter boy this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
in our species , we do n t like doing that .
and actually in many ways , they re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
so let me tell you what happened with tracy shapiro .
this picture is mahatma gandhi in the s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing t . b . in his ashram in sevagram in india .
if this is true , if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that s what they re for we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
i had to do something .
the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents gdp per capita .
we did this with and month old babies .
now , neither chris nor i were the type to shy away from a challenge , and hearing , being right just is n t enough , seemed all the more reason to take on this fight .
one of the things that is sad is that , actually , the us is lagging behind .
so many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
johnson and lakoff suggest a new metaphor for love love as a collaborative work of art .
but you and i do n t know . we do n t have the data .
it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .
joker ready ! mt let me see what you ve got .
applause that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile .
consider a few stats for a moment .
i walked underneath it for the first time .
and when you petition the supreme court , you have to present a question that you want the court to answer .
applause it s a disaster ! that s not a language .
so we used the branch as a mold for our first invention .
the first one is that these little month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we do n t always want the same thing .
there it is , and it survives .
something lost behind the mountains .
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber times stronger than steel .
i believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and i m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the greek hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
ends up split decision , to .
but i was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the u . n .
we are starting at the end of the summer .
they were brilliant people . i m not dissing the neanderthals .
you find a sheep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it .
and some years ago , i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
if it does n t close , the baby has a hole in the heart .
i was very happy to hear that .
the who and the why are what s important to me .
so when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
and by the way , that s one of the reasons that i m not interested in the debate about i . q . , about whether some groups have higher i . q . s than other groups .
this is the real cool part . it s called collections .
when i became president , the difference was percent .
so that s where the lenses go .
we learned a lot from those failures .
in a way that dresses like us and thinks like we do .
so you have to be careful with hacker .
i had not anticipated this before , but a really interesting link between hands on science education and global health .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
please , i beg of you , even though my time has finished , either arabic , english , french or chinese .
it does n t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece
what s the process that s having the same effect in cultural evolution as sex is having in biological evolution
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
and now , seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the society of women engineers .
doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole .
but we live in a place that is , feet high .
no big deal , right
the argument itself was riveting .
so up till now , you did n t actually see what i would see from one of these setups .
there were between and people killed all together .
it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men .
my goal of the design is not when it s completed .
you look around at all these museums here .
but there s a big difference , which is that it only happens within the colony .
and i think the answer is exchange , the habit of exchanging one thing for another .
same as the other side .
and in the future , as we go forward , we will , of course , experience terrible things .
now there s a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle . the interesting question is , which
our hearts ache , and then they break .
chris argued brilliantly .
trade is times as old as farming .
and why does exchange raise living standards
and i m very honored by the fact that michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a unaids ambassador .
however , bad things happen .
then i wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building
and that s because they re both designed to fit the human hand .
i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .
i ve subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv .
laughter we ll just we can just skip i ll just skip through the video instead . . . laughter
you ve seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded by black and yellow tape with do n t kill your language ! written on it .
now . . . laughter okay . laughter now , we re going to do a little demonstration , right
i started writing fiction in english .
i m going to show you some examples here , and we will run through some of them .
i asked her once how things were going .
in , in italy , l aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
so what is the basic thing that we need to do today
it was armed with this knowledge that ultimately i would gather together my shattered self , each fragment represented by a different voice , gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry , only this time from the other side .
now , i just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about avelile .
this is when we were thinking about the idea .
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
it was only because of our passports .
he said , as long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . so we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , i found i did n t have my keys .
what we looked at in detail was ownership networks .
i proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because l aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
how long is it going to take you quite a long time .
all from the simple setup that i actually described .
survival depends on communication between the systemic and the pulmonary blood .
it s the number one place in the nation because of that .
they do n t have enough flat area to build standard government single story housing like this one .
it s not confined to its own lineage .
they re always made from local chert .
physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
thank you .
now i combine them with hi tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings .
student there s two up there .
it s always been a dream of mine to have done a ted talk in the past .
that s why they legislate to protect their language .
and i was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
and so i want to talk about that .
our consciousness of that thing that we re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
and in fact , the baby s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
photos of cool guys and girls .
it just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male .
what happens when you cut people off from exchange , from the ability to exchange and specialize
so armed with these two ideas , that science is a way of being and experiments are play , we asked , can anyone become a scientist
so this is under construction .
it s not written by me . it s written by amy and the other students in the class . as a consequence , this science paper begins , once upon a time . . . laughter the results section , it says training phase , the puzzle . . . duh duh duuuuuhhh . right laughter and the methods , it says , then we put the bees into the fridge and made bee pie , smiley face . right laughter this is a science paper . we re going to try to get it published .
and remember that number one billion .
and there s no reason why there ca n t be a retiree internship program .
in the united states , the number was three times higher than in sweden .
you zoom in . you really go in .
and then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
and this is the name of my campaign sing campaign .
death death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the organic .
i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal .
that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success .
so , imagine if we were all less passive in love .
applause thank you . applause
this is n t easy , either .
it s not easy to come back from such a place and rise .
but , if you have n t noticed , now we re not in tribal times .
i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv aids orphans .
they re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
solar technology is . . .
this one , it turns out , is actually designed specifically for malaria , because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria .
this also shows you how the projection scope works .
thank you .
i m afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways . laughter in other words , it starts off once upon a time , the figures are in crayon , etc . laughter so we said , we ll get it reviewed . so i sent it to dale purves , who is at the national academy of science , one of the leading neuroscientists in the world , and he says , this is the most original science paper i have ever read laughter and it certainly deserves wide exposure .
so , it was obviously it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story .
drybath is a rich man s convenience and a poor man s lifesaver .
even though the pinnacle of modern science , research microscopes are not designed for field testing .
this is the starry night , i think , never seen like this before .
it s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected , and also it s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it s industrial material , it s also possible to fireproof .
boy what s making this light up .
now , that s not because there are no rich americans who are stashing their assets offshore .
how many other people
he told me i d be going with him the next morning .
nobody knows .
pretty yucky , you would agree with me .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
here s what we find on testosterone .
so this is a huge practical problem .
now it s actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters .
and i m going to pick one randomly .
the first author is blackawton primary school , because if it were ever referenced , it would be blackawton et al , and not one individual . so we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this .
and it s happening during our lifetimes .
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
well , it means everything s fine until this happens .
well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
and perception underpins everything we think , we know , we believe , our hopes , our dreams , the clothes we wear , falling in love , everything begins with perception .
and this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last years that s actually demonstrated it .
and more than that , it s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
i tasted the broccoli . mmmmm . and then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she d go , eww , yuck , crackers .
we have the world s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there s actually an answer .
chimpanzees , killer whales , these kinds of creatures , they have culture .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
i remember , for example , sitting up one night on guard outside my parents room to protect them from what i thought was a genuine threat from the voices .
methods , what did you do results , what was the observation
i can turn it on and throw it on the floor and really try to stomp on it .
so you do n t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , a slingshot or maybe a spear might work . which would actually be better
when the sea level rose and tasmania became an island , years ago , the people on it not only experienced slower progress than people on the mainland , they actually experienced regress .
because they re experts in play . so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon , and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently , but , through the process of science , to see themselves differently . right
so what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to facebook after you die .
how
here s one from cristine legare s lab .
after all , one of the things that s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
and if they re not up to speed , then it s their responsibility to get there .
the question why is one of the most dangerous things you can do , because it takes you into uncertainty .
because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
gene patents typically contain dozens of claims , but the most controversial of these are to so called isolated dna namely , a piece of dna that has been removed from a cell .
they say no .
right now there are hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute .
we have , you know , the day after tomorrow it looks great , right
babies , after all , ca n t talk , and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks , what you ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
how did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time
and a couple of years ago , i decided to write about procrastination .
the four groups will publish their data in november of this year .
music voice system ready . acquiring image .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
there they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they did n t know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder .
and it was long distance for the first couple of years , so for me that meant very high highs and very low lows .
that s exciting in itself .
i made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , i used beer crates as a foundation .
so for us , the next step actually is really finishing our field trials .
very simply , you go in and i ve created this , called the power of zoom you can just zoom around .
so now we sought review by the supreme court .
and what we ve done in human society , through exchange and specialization , is we ve created the ability to do things that we do n t even understand .
i am of course quoting from a famous essay by leonard read , the economist in the s , called i , pencil in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made , and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil , because the people who assemble it do n t know how to mine graphite , and they do n t know how to fell trees and that kind of thing .
so even though this looks like a simple toy , the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated .
for your passport , a particular drawer .
i m sitting here in new york with michel sidibe he s the director of unaids .
on this picture , you have my father in law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
and it looked like the kfc special spice , you know
ag okay , he s got his experimental notebook out .
so we did just this we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
we can see the big picture .
i had no guidebook and very little money , and i spoke no spanish .
it s because perception is grounded in our experience .
so , how did this happen
and also i found out there s many vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a catholic church all the building was totally destroyed .
with my wife and partner , dr . alexandra heath , we started to see patients .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right
this is happening in reality .
and because god loves her , i did get married .
we are at a stage where we ll be making thousands of microscopes .
so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
wake up .
so i went there and also i proposed to the priests , why do n t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes
so in some ways , we think that this baby s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
in the case of the stone axe , the man who made it knew how to make it .
that s the responsibility of architects .
but the object on the right was made for me by other people .
something very easy , yet creative and persuasive .
it s new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
they re both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree .
and essentially , in the end , all the parts line up because of origami , because of the fact that origami allows us micron scale precision of optical alignment .
i went off on my own to become an artist , and i painted for years , when i was offered a fulbright to india .
having put the product into practice , we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market , and one question i have for the audience today is , on the gravel roads of limpopo , with an allowance of rand a week , i came up with a way for the world not to bathe .
i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck .
it is also about destroying their property , their cultural heritage , and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed .
and what s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
oecd does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
now if you look at these five ways of being , these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist .
no . laughter laughter
so with this focus on cost cutting , i asked myself , are we forgetting the patient
that is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
back in i started noticing something .
so there are two really remarkable things about this .
is it early , as in , you re in advance and you have to educate the world
and the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between and , years ago in africa , when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in ethiopia .
and that will have led to specialization .
creativity in your mother tongue is the path .
i m using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time like an x ray of the city s circulatory system unfolding .
there are inherent benefits to this .
but timing might matter even more .
is the idea way too early and the world s not ready for it
so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector .
winter is like magic . it s a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears .
changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard . it all depends on the way the person feels about change .
i think if we saw leaks from the cayman islands or even from delaware or wyoming or nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to americans .
supreme court justice sandra day o connor took a five year career break early in her career .
after all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
we re struck .
it literally says , wat ar ou rea in laughter right
but look at this . there s no privacy .
this version of love allows us to say things like , hey , we re not very good collaborators . maybe this is n t for us .
whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years .
this paper has no instructions and no languages .
now we re already starting to see some experiments here .
that is to say , they specialize with respect to reproduction .
video boy how about this
but i m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i m also sure that technology will advance , and therefore living standards will advance .
now i am working in new zealand , christchurch .
now , i want to tell you a story about seeing differently , and all new perceptions begin in the same way .
this is this is intense material , i should warn you .
they re just learning how to count .
and so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills .
after many trials , and with the help of my grandmother s indigenous friends in the mountains , we obtained a new device .
we asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color , but to a certain color flower only when it s in a certain pattern .
and in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
gibran khalil gibran , when he first started writing , he used arabic .
for example , in the caucasus there s a site where you find local neanderthal tools .
historic philadelphia city hall its plaza , i felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .
how do you say whether this guy understands or not
so , it s not true that there s no solution there is a solution !
but who knows how to make a computer mouse
other creatures , like the crows , are n t very good at doing anything in particular , but they re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
for example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
ja yeah , we have a lot , but i mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated . uncertainty is what makes play fun .
sort of .
instead , i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
he asked me to build three story housing on baseball fields .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
but that s completely wrong .
now play is not simply a process . experts in play will tell you that actually it s a way of being .
tracy loved this company , and she loved the people and the office was less than minutes from her house .
now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it s all logical , but is it possible
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
all right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
and that s what we ve done , because we re all working for each other .
year in haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it s impossible to fly over , so i went to santo domingo , next door country , to drive six hours to get to haiti with the local students in santo domingo to build units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
if i say , freedom , sovereignty , independence arabic , what does this remind you of
but what if you want to see brush strokes
no other animal does it .
and the optical components , if you look at the inset up on the right , we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs , so it uses a process of self assembly and surface tension to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself .
once a year , they publish the league table who s best , who s at the bottom
now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
and back in , it would have been minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage .
to the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
my artistic horizons continue to grow .
so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger
this is the sort of behavior that affects all of us .
when i was a student here in oxford in the s , the future of the world was bleak .
but then , the funniest thing happened .
and what miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops .
how did we achieve that , whether you think it s a good thing or not
go back to this image of the axe and the mouse , and ask yourself who made them and for who the stone axe was made by someone for himself .
tell me about you . thank you .
the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
she s a six monther .
and to be fair , i was desperate for interest and help , and i began to tell him about my strange commentator .
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .
i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students .
he can make his own spears and axes .
he looked over the group and he said first he raised his hand , i forgot that he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , thank you .
so here s the title page . we have a number of authors there .
ag okay , there s his fifth hypothesis .
the most complex problems in our time can be solved with simple techniques , if we are able to dream .
yes , you know , patents on human genes .
the test was negative .
so , if we ca n t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
finally i met a very nice mayor in onagawa village in miyagi .
in the late s , there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
one of them is to take that real . . .
so this is my sing campaign .
we still have this monster soup around , and it s taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt .
it s called a microscope .
what first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by derek k . miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
it s to supplement the experience .
laughter and at least until they re , we re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
you can imagine what something like this might look like five , or years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
it s also important to not just think about this as individual cases .
there were literally thousands of patents on human genes .
and i m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
right
oops , i m sorry . what was going on
when it s done , it looks something like this , has all the functionalities of a standard microscope , just like an xy stage , a place where a sample slide could go , for example right here .
it s easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he s doing , because that s what we do in the lab , but for a teacher not to know what s going to happen at the end of the day so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick , who was the collaborator on this project . okay
how many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after , years
i mean earth .
three years and two children later , we raised this , square foot lace net .
i know that this is asking a lot , but i m not actually the first person to suggest this .
in their book , metaphors we live by , linguists mark johnson and george lakoff suggest a really interesting solution to this dilemma , which is to change our metaphors .
this can happen .
this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and i would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
marco tempest for those of you who do n t play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades .
i wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when i was a teenager .
now if perception is grounded in our history , it means we re only ever responding according to what we ve done before .
it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . thank you very much .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i had n t realized that the hiv aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .
we made up .
the search started again .
linguists talk about metaphors as having entailments , which is essentially a way of considering all the implications of , or ideas contained within , a given metaphor .
applause
bl this is the epitome of technology . right . okay .
oh , that s all my time
so we ve created something called the collective brain .
please congratulate your children s team from my side . so i d like to conclude with a physical metaphor .
but then i was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
okay laughter even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty .
had eileen received the proper result , kathleen would have then been tested , and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented .
so i thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
so what happens for adults is we decide that something s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
as a child , i discovered that creativity is the key to cross from dreams to reality .
they published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
okay , one , two , three . audience can you read this
but in the meantime , if you are returning to work after a career break , do n t hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program .
and minutes later , he came bursting in my office .
now it s good to be a grownup .
you would n t believe it s a local product .
in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date , , years ago , and some of those are from local chert , but more but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away .
so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists , right , putting in the references , and we submit it to biology letters .
sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .
they were imaginative . they buried their dead .
the deadline for the show arrived my paints did n t .
then i completed the pompidou center in metz .
the fetus needs to survive inside the mother .
not working either .
you get to see the beam the way it s projected and bent .
then came a moment of inspiration .
and there s another difference too , which is the object on the left is made from one substance .
as i watched the wind s choreography unfold , i felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky .
, there was a big disaster in rwanda , africa .
that was the problem .
and they last , even though they re designed from a very flexible material , like paper .
today , i m using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world .
it starts with a single sheet of paper .
aaron motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary .
well , it was published two days before christmas , downloaded , times in the first day , right
there are cards in each suit . music voice each card represents a phase of the lunar cycles .
voice the moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic .
we re doing two different things here .
so what opened my eyes
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
for your reading glasses , a particular table .
so , when he started writing in english , he had enough baggage .
in one month , we completed nine classrooms , over square meters .
those are the kinds of things that go on in our society .
another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species kind of like caterpillars and butterflies except that they re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
so in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
over . billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation .
an example is tasmania .
what was the feedback like
these are just a few examples .
the coil , if it works , can save lives .
thank you . today , we re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . by measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
voice signed card detected . mt well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician is it a to job
how long do you actually have to work to earn an hour of reading light if you re on the average wage in britain today
in the old days , if you were rich , you literally had people working for you .
so they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green .
there s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live .
and our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
but before i give it away , i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you re doing with your body .
science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
and only the latter is an artist s responsibility . identity politics divides us . fiction connects .
radio . . . just fuckin , once you get on em just open em up .
but actually , it s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently
but it s just so much better than the alternative , which is that thing that feels like madness .
laughter even in england , we do n t leave reproduction to the queen .
so one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
and ultimately , some physicians will say today that they do n t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
. . . paying attention to crowd sourcing .
carousel , carousel , carousel , carousel .
then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
remember , when you re under stress , the brain releases cortisol .
now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who , back in march , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than , hours of home video .
various diseases thrive in this environment , the most drastic of which is called trachoma .
and that s seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you ve gained since , as it were , because that s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can acquire another good or service .
the customer is the true reality .
here i am in oslo in norway , getting a nice , fat check singing in hong kong , trying to get people to raise money .
it s a self portrait titled wide hips . laughter we hoisted them on poles to photograph .
so for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients .
for two years , i searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .
this is how the year would go .
and now we want to share . that s the next step .
and all this at a time when the population has doubled .
but it actually makes a lot of sense they should , because bees , like us , can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day , the light , the weather , or from any angle they approach it from . applause bl so the next step was to design an experiment , which is a game . so the kids went off and they designed this experiment , and so well , game and so , amy , can you tell us what the game was , and the puzzle that you set the bees
so , now you think , how is that possible
they have a new ceo , and she has a vision i want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
and i m getting the hairs on my i do n t know if you can see the hairs on my arms .
be their first success story , and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come .
both brains have a rational decision maker in them , but the procrastinator s brain also has an instant gratification monkey .
what is going on in this baby s mind
music voice if you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is .
you can imagine that that s him writing in english , the same boy who came from the mountain . from a village on mount lebanon .
there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
and the cool part is , one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand .
laughter that s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o clock in the morning . laughter
where s the logic in that
they work in the field .
. meters from here , back to here , centimeters .
five months later , we went back to south africa to meet avelile again .
it really comes from these artists .
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .
and that s evidence that people have started exchanging between groups .
laughter now chris is a really brilliant lawyer , but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics .
well , i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
so they re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they re not much good at doing anything else .
people suffer mentally and physically .
and it was probably the most unhappy year of my life .
that sounds terrible .
it s not the same with language .
two of my students , jim and james , traveled around india and thailand , starting to think about this problem a lot .
i was mesmerized .
one service called my next tweet analyzes your entire twitter stream , everything you ve posted onto twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
this is avelile she goes with me wherever i go .
here , you ve got martian alphabet .
and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness .
and that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you re going to be helpless .
this really should not be surprising , considering that according to wikipedia , there are eight films , songs , two albums and one novel with the title crazy love . about half an hour later , he came back to our room .
he helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .
our biology tells us that love is good by activating these reward circuits in our brain , and it tells us that love is painful when , after a fight or a breakup , that neurochemical reward is withdrawn .
why seriously , do n t kill your language .
and we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently
so what is evolution s answer to the problem of uncertainty
anyone who s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re operated on in their lifetime .
love makes us crazy , and it makes us sick .
and the man knows that he does n t have to do any digging to get roots .
they do the simple mathematics , averaging , etc . , etc .
i am an impostor .
fourteen years ago , i searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms .
justice roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree .
everyone is crowding round when fortune is your friend .
boy it s lighting up .
myriad held patents on two genes , the brca and the brca genes .
so the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this .
i did n t know if i could do that and preserve my art .
you see that glass of water
so , here are some of the questions . i put them in small print so you would n t bother reading it . point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to years . right
so , if i say , freedom , sovereignty , independence english , or if your son came up to you and said , dad , have you lived through the period of the freedom english slogan
if you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
but of course the decision goes far beyond myriad .
most of us do feel a bit mad in the early stages of romantic love .
i will keep on saying internet i would n t say i m going to the world wide web laughs because it does n t fit ! we should n t kid ourselves .
all of you know this from eighth grade , remember
and that s the way society works .
so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is
finally , think back to this famous scene from election night back in the united states , where cnn beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will . i . am into their studio for an interview with anderson cooper .
and then i burst into tears .
whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
when year old juliet first meets or , when year old juliet can not be with romeo , whom she has met four days ago , she does not feel disappointed or angsty .
and if you re lucky , and you re one of the percent who has these , they ll only last for a year or two .
we have fewer spousal or partner job relocations .
but a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv s pictures , he has people doing his dinner tonight too .
let me give you just one example of this .
i fell in love for the first time when i was , and it was a pretty turbulent relationship right from the start .
maybe you can relieve the phantom pain , the phantom cramp .
you also see seashells as discovered by a team here in oxford moving miles inland from the mediterranean in algeria .
when my first novel written in english came out in america , i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic .
these are the three stages that you actually see .
dave strudwick so you keep track of each . student henry , can you help me here
and you re thinking , what kind of crazy statistic is that
bl what are you reading there are no words there .
and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
what was really exciting about this project was we , and beau , had no idea whether it would work .
so i tried to rank across all of those attributes how i felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions .
i d seen it every day , but this time i saw it differently a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .
the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by .
they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now .
he just knows how to run a company .
in an asexual species , if you get two different mutations in different creatures , a green one and a red one , then one has to be better than the other .
actually , in german , it s nein nein . laughter magic is n t that intense . i have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , do n t play for money .
applause this intersection had been bland and anonymous .
we d have to find an existence .
ok , let s go back to mr . elmo .
so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
so they re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we re production and marketing .
it is n t always quite that simple , but there s a distinction between specialized roles for males and females .
they were a highly intelligent species .
that would be the plan .
avelile s mother had hiv virus she died from aids related illness .
mt well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that i received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , i have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . applause voice and who are these mt ah , mischief makers . watch .
i like to think of it a bit like a russian doll .
even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
now essentially , this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind , a kind of psychic civil war , and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing .
thank you very much .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they re bad at not paying attention .
louis xiv had a lot of people working for him .
after that we released photos of guys and girls wearing the arabic letter .
forget nuclear holocaust it s the fork that we have to worry about .
but i ve got no evidence for that .
they re a little bigger . they re a prototype .
right there .
applause
i do n t literally mean hours , seven days a week .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange and indeed there s reciprocity in other animals but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
how does evolution do cumulative , combinatorial things
some of them are driven to suicide , ok
what s relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas , and how well they re cooperating , not how clever the individuals are .
because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
she was looking for a finance or accounting role , and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results .
we all are going to fail now and then .
you can not humiliate the person who feels pride .
this was the beginning . the voice had arrived .
but having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom , my fear and resistance towards it intensified .
it maybe does n t look so fancy to you now , but that was our first successful attempt to create a device for this major problem .
my idea is no ! no !
applause
we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .
well , maybe i m just cynical , and all these words are lies , but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise .
it s still used , even after the current earthquake in china .
so what is a foldscope
this testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers , and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires .
i cherish those memories , because they helped me to understand life outside the city , a life with a lot of possibilities , without barriers , as language or culture .
and i knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
and what you ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
so here is another obvious thing that we would do , typically , if i was going to show that these microscopes are robust , is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself .
now at first , i would have believed them .
this is the first temporary building made out of paper .
but the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position .
everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
while that might be a somewhat morbid thought , i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
why is that
the first thing i told tracy was she had to get out of the house .
a naturally occurring dna segment is a product of nature , and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated .
in this case , chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks .
and i think just the opposite is true .
i saw two universities integrate internships into mid career executive education programs .
i can remember one moment in particular .
redemption , smoke .
and it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
it goes into a sort of denial it gates the signals .
but unconsciously , they re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
but we re talking about perception here , right
returning to india to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand tied knots installed briefly in madrid .
now all of the babies , even in berkley , like the crackers and do n t like the raw broccoli .
together , we can end the secrecy that is currently allowing tax evasion , corruption , money laundering to flourish .
if he instead would go to hamburg , and to a clinic called the martini klinik , the risk would be only one in .
one of the major challenges we had in preparing the case was figuring out how best to communicate the science .
that s how you got to be rich you employed them .
the work would be publishable if done by adults . so what did we do we send it back to the editor .
so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
if he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
i started commuting to kobe , and i met the society of vietnamese people .
and the side effects in that case occur in percent of the patients .
so if you add rules to play , you have a game .
how do people release the documents
so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
curiosity , interest , innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science .
now , you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , heart attack , stroke .
my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone , but at midnight , it could take a while for a locksmith to show up , and it was cold .
in advance , i asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message i wrote the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . now , while as a journalist , miller s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that s something completely different than anything that s been created by any previous generation .
i see your element , uh , got about four humvees , uh , out along . . .
there is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse .
and to whoever might say , ha ! you used an english word ! i say , no ! i adopt the word cool . let them object however they want , but give me a word that s nicer and matches the reality better .
people returning to work after a career break i call them relaunchers .
we built units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
i decided that if my friends could not understand my grievous affliction , then i did not need their friendship .
he was a soft dictator of kenya .
we need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
but if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that s not been the purpose in the first place .
its shape was too complex now .
we discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements
what you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope .
there will be wars there will be depressions there will be natural disasters .
they re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , in the shelters built by the u . n . , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
i just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , this guy is amazing ! laughter
they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
leadership is a choice . it is not a rank .
we re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other s living standards .
ao yeah .
gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients .
but this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment .
and that s perhaps because some prominent us people just have n t figured in this expose , in this scandal .
death go to ifidie . net before it s too late .
we can make it better .
and here is a stone age version of his story , although he told it in terms of trade between countries .
so , there are three stages there is the optical stage , the illumination stage and the mask holding stage .
how do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration
this is an a sheet of paper .
alison gopnik okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
i have these two microscopes that i m going to turn go to the back of the wall and just project , and this way you will see exactly what i would see .
and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
laughter but then what betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent .
and if i could prove it , then we would have to end up together eventually .
so my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever i forget them in the dryer .
and it sent me back .
laughter adam ostrow kind of creepy , right
now , in the animal world , that works fine .
and that s it . thank you .
and in this way , i ve been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .
she was one of the young people who was involved in this study , and she s now one of the youngest published scientists in the world . right she will now , once she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted . right
many people have harmed me in my life , and i remember them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who ve helped me .
this is a tool this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv , people who are living with hiv .
who else can have these qualities more than children
so in the district court the government submitted a brief on myriad s side .
it s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped .
instead , i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
ao this project was really exciting for me , because it brought the process of discovery to life , and it showed me that anyone , and i mean anyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that a small question can lead into a big discovery .
and from here , we re able to do the same sorts of registration , not only of still images , but also of video .
so we have a very focused , purpose driven kind of attention .
and they are very kind , affording my model .
so this is all of the meta data information .
so after seeing these shocking statistics , i thought to myself , okay , even if i m not just doing it for myself and the fact that i do n t want to bathe , i at least need to do it to try to save the world . laughter so with my trusty little steed , my nokia cell phone i did n t have a laptop , i did n t have internet much , except for the rand an hour internet cafe i did research on wikipedia , on google , about lotions , creams , the compositions , the melting points , the toxicities i did high school science and i wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper ,
and if you actually look in their brains , you see that they re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts have n t come on yet .
avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus .
language represents specific stages in our lives , and terminology that is linked to our emotions .
the tasmanians were isolated .
it might take a moment to load .
and this is a bird on the cover of science who s learned how to use a tool to get food .
so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
now these are some rather obvious things .
but we receive strength from our patients .
laughter i did n t know where to begin , but i said yes .
and then some of our failures .
you flip a coin . fifty percent risk . that s quite a lot .
the person on the assembly line does n t know because he does n t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
so we had to create it .
what you re looking at applause this is a cross section of a compound eye , and when i m going to zoom in closer , right there , i am going through the z axis .
and i think that s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
laughter so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that s ready to go to the market . it s actually available on the market .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
how could it be that children are doing statistics
but do n t write arabic with latin characters mixed with numbers !
and who better to ask than eight to year old children
if you add that up , that s million dollars it costs california to send a person to be executed .
there are tubes , diameter centimeters , there are only tubes with a diameter of centimeters , or four feet , wide .
it was self sufficiency .
there s no exchange of ideas between them .
so they said , we probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what s best . so they in fact spent two years debating , so what is quality in hip surgery
so the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who s best , and they learn from it .
adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe .
i understand that th century verona is unlike contemporary north america , and yet when i first read this play , also at age , juliet s suffering made sense to me .
really , we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions . so what if bees can think like us
and we ll say the frequency is . kilohertz , or .
music voice why not that s a very good hand .
know that china believes in the market and the state .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
but half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , mmmmm , broccoli .
and that s me with youssou n dour , onstage , having the time of my life .
laughter all of that s going to take a while , so we re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today .
now , i m a neuroscientist by training and i know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress .
forget about this headache and go have fun . no problem !
four hundred and fifty million of them are in africa , and five million of them are in south africa .
now , that s not the only exciting part .
well , if you must , i have a recipe for you .
well , it d be amazing , since we re talking about an insect with only one million brain cells .
think about our life stage for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons , we have fewer or no maternity leaves .
a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in south africa .
and so i committed when i left south africa , when i left capetown , i told myself , this is going to be something that i have to talk about .
and she would act as if she liked it or she did n t .
applause thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . applause
i could n t build this the way i knew because hand tied knots were n t going to withstand a hurricane .
and also i still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty . laughter so i remember it was so disappointing .
after , the building was recycled .
exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years .
this is the ambassadors , based in the national gallery .
and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .
can you show that you had legal authority over that document
i think now i never was pure .
in some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
my life was not going to be the same .
this is a reality that developed societies are aware of .
that s a science paper , basically . laughter so the kids give me the words , right i put it into a narrative , which means that this paper is written in kidspeak .
why would that be
so , i m going to count to you , so we do n t all do it together .
joker whoa . mt are you ready for your party piece
i liked your book , he said , but i wish you had written it differently .
this was described beautifully in a book in by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg .
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
so here i m going to show you two tandem clips .
they looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery .
this is kathleen maxian .
but with technology , we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities .
but changing the way i thought about science was surprisingly easy . once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle , i then realized that science is n t just a boring subject , and that anyone can discover something new .
but i suspect this experience of love is not that unusual .
so if you want to know what s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , i think it actually looks something like this .
pimp my carroca took to the streets of sao paulo , rio de janeiro and curitiba .
there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .
there are million tweets being posted every day .
it does n t have to be in the closet . i became a member of treatment action campaign and i m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
and we saw people who had a functional microscope but just did n t know how to even turn it on .
this type of society is not only possible , it s already on its way .
and three in here .
and then she would simply put her hand out and say , can you give me some
of course there were a few changes , but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .
love is unpredictable , love is creative , love requires communication and discipline , it is frustrating and emotionally demanding .
per capita food production is up by a third .
they buy products on demand . a person in alex does n t buy a box of cigarettes . they buy one cigarette each day , even though it s more expensive .
different pool , same concept .
laughter there is a difference .
it s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
this is because you get to stop thinking about yourself and what you re gaining or losing in your relationship , and you get to start thinking about what you have to offer .
what grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call foldscopes .
if we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
thank you very much .
they go out and test it against the evidence .
if you re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you re a huge success !
this is not just about an individual lawyer who s spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
underneath , i was actually deeply unhappy , insecure and fundamentally frightened frightened of other people , of the future , of failure and of the emptiness that i felt was within me .
they re the ones that question the things we think to be true already . right
no , no , it was very , very bad .
mt bye bye . music thank you . applause applause thank you very much . applause applause
i mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
but here .
for example , i was part of a student tv station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , i said , i m sorry , doctor , i ve got to go .
so much about a team s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer .
translate that for me .
there s a lot of other stuff here , but i do n t have time .
well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
it s play .
you just need an opportunity . my opportunity came in the form of beau , and the blackawton bee project .
after creating that model , we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product .
it s just because of the way in which offshore works , mossack fonseca has fewer american clients .
thank you . bl thank you very much . applause applause
then i started looking at the business model .
we submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever .
it was an afternoon in the fall of .
my son is .
she said to me , he listens to fairuz with me , and one night , i tried to translate for him so he can feel what i feel when i listen to fairuz . the poor woman tried to translate this for him from them i extended my hands and stole you laughter and here s the pickle and because you belong to them , i returned my hands and left you . laughter
and the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
there s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
and they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
year , there was a big expo in germany .
that s the first time we ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
the release of these papers from panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world .
and there s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
good morning . so magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
it seems like we want it both ways we want love to feel like madness , and we want it to last an entire lifetime .
as a very wonderful doctor once said to me , do n t tell me what other people have told you about yourself .
he said , as long as you bring your money , you can do it . and i was very lucky .
i went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
it would do a lot of good , but it s also very , very costly .
our goal is to make sure that no child is left behind , not because of cost or access .
unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as danny kahneman and his colleagues have shown .
it s good to be a grownup .
voice i think you got your birthday wish . mt and that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all the one with this very significant mark on it .
i asked her how she did this . was it the power of praying
this is the transformation that took place .
but was there a way we could challenge them
so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way .
thank you .
laughter i do n t know .
i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in lithuania with lace makers .
the arabic language does n t satisfy today s needs .
a hospital admission followed , the first of many , a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next , and then , worst of all , a toxic , tormenting sense of hopelessness , humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects .
but we wondered if there s a possible link with other animals . it d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
they actually thrive from peer recognition .
applause
most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy , and , at least in theory , as a matter of law .
another service right now is called , memories .
light em all up .
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
this version of love is not about winning or losing someone s affection .
we should be celebrating play .
well no , because if you think about it , if oz makes two spears and adam make two axes , and then they trade , then they will each have saved an hour of work .
now , i m not saying whether you should take the statin or not .
two six , this is two six , we re mobile .
i do n t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
but those people from the past , they do n t know about any of this .
the second quote is from the head of the uk financial services authority .
this issue was put on the political agenda by the uk prime minister david cameron at a big g summit that was held in northern ireland in .
countries that were once like us , but decided to strive for development , do research , and catch up with those countries , such as turkey , malaysia and others , they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder , protected it like a diamond .
then one day you wake up , and they tell you you re a queen , but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings .
four words are human genes patentable
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
okay , so fine .
we re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
thank you so much .
the president of the computer mouse company does n t know .
i got a call from a friend in phoenix .
chris anderson julian , welcome .
we re in a more settled time of life .
i tasted the crackers . eww , yuck . so she d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .
but i must say they are no longer natural disasters .
in fact , i could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where i had left them .
all right , why would we see this correlation
if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
my goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
and most of us feel this way when we first fall in love .
and that s been my humbling experience in this .
there s bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the house and the senate , but it is n t making as much progress as we d like to see .
i want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
on the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
one thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what s going on in the mind of that other baby .
you ve probably all heard of google s project glass .
right we normally walk through life responding , but if we ever want to do anything different , we have to step into uncertainty . when he opened his eyes , he was able to see the world in a new way .
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation .
so suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , i just got your lab work back , your cholesterol s a little high .
in the last years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
can we get the lights back on again
when children do experiments we call it getting into everything or else playing . and there s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year .
i saw goldman sachs and sara lee start corporate reentry internship programs .
but if you have a sexual species , then it s possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different lineages .
you can see the bars of the window there .
all he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it s big enough to share some .
so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
so i m not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it , but the next step is observation . so here are some of the students doing the observations . they re recording the data of where the bees fly .
so i contacted noaa , and i asked if they d share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this .
voice marco , i did not know you could do that . laughter mt and is it a coincidence that there are cards in a deck of cards , just as there are weeks in a year
a coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself .
bury me english this is one of the few examples .
anyway , we realized that we could save million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for homework , two hours more to just be a kid .
we re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
as adam smith said , no man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog . laughter you can have culture without exchange .
so this is what changes , but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases .
then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line .
we turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the arabic language .
i ve got a plastic fork , do n t you know strategic .
well , the answer came from david ricardo in .
and in studies we ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we ve show that four year olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
and since then , the european union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across europe .
they were always best in class .
boy that s why .
laughter boy oh , it s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
you take a stain , like acridine orange or a fluorescent stain or giemsa , and a microscope , and you look at them .
larry maloney , expert in vision , says , the paper is magnificent .
and i ll just read one .
the campaign to preserve arabic launched a slogan that says , i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west .
and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber illusionist .
if these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
they re standing up because i know what i m going to show you .
and is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island .
i read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .
now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this is n t only an idea .
they will share the information on how to improve .
i saw real patients and i wore the white coat for the first time in years , in fact since i became a management consultant .
i ll start with the obvious ones .
oh my god , oh my god , it s moving again !
i think that s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we re producing and technology s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
it was a very , very bad thesis . laughter
shimon schocken right , but i like myself .
if you d asked people this years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric that he could n t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
but over two million people cut trees .
so it turns out they re waterproof , and laughter right here is just fluorescent water , and i do n t know if you can actually see this .
and he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
the holes in children s hearts can be closed with it .
so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows , and they were locked tight .
is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . laughter applause music whoa .
they are heavy , bulky , really hard to maintain , and cost a lot of money .
when i first started researching romantic love , i found these madness metaphors everywhere .
global famine was inevitable .
but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .
so if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u . s . and sweden .
i have to serve . and so , subsequently i participated in every single event that i could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to mandela out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
i think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
i was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat , the founder of treatment action campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist .
promising to give exhibitions of paintings , i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram .
with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .
this was discovered by francis galton in the nineteenth century .
it can change by itself into very complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
now , what is this , the nnt
why is that
during those trips , my grandmother used to recite a kipling poem something hidden . go and find it .
applause
this was in the fall of .
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
of course , you can also see it on the website , and we ll also talk about it more , i m sure , as the day goes on .
expect that , and do n t be discouraged by it .
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
that s what you should have said . right why is this
a subtle conditioning process had begun , the implication that normal people do n t hear voices and the fact that i did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
recording adam ostrow hello .
or , that relationship was shorter than i had planned , but it was still kind of beautiful . the beautiful thing about the collaborative work of art is that it will not paint or draw or sculpt itself .
it s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts .
laughter here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts . laughter
the only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch .
it was completely new , and no one had done it before , including adults . laughter bl including the teachers , and that was really hard for the teachers .
so as we were sunbathing , my best friend next to me says , man , why does n t somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you do n t have to bathe and i sat , and i was like , man , i would buy that , eh so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very shocking statistics .
when we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
one goes extinct for the other to survive .
he was wearing a t shirt like the one i wear now .
now that is a particularly that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
there were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
right
does she want to commit suicide
you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images .
in fact , after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
and then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
right it s adaptable to change . right it opens possibility , and it s cooperative . it s actually how we do our social bonding , and it s intrinsically motivated . what that means is that we play to play . play is its own reward .
they ve worked four working groups have worked during the past year cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
do we get what s going to be now happening one day in the future
here is a sheet of paper .
this version of love allows us to decide what it looks like .
myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on brca testing in the united states .
thank you very much .
so the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
because i want to show points of interest .
so what do we know about complex systems
and you ca n t patent laws of nature the law of gravity , e mc .
but actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
so in the home , designate a spot for your keys a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl .
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement .
here s what he wrote in starting that out .
he s alive , he s healthy , he s just been banished from the city .
well , i think , probably , the oldest version of this is probably the sexual division of labor .
the evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
language is n t one , two or three words or letters put together .
now living in europe , he can choose to go to germany that has a well reputed healthcare system .
he was a cousin of charles darwin .
that is prosperity , the saving of time in satisfying your needs .
thank you .
but then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
and in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t shirt i say , yes , we can talk about this issue .
where the highs are heaven , but the lows , oh , they can be hell .
and the more they do this , the more true it s going to be , because the more they do this , the better adam is going to get at making axes and the better oz is going to get at making spears .
you d be entering a virtual world with a virtual language .
everyone over there shout . shouts where s the sound coming from laughter applause thank you very much . applause what s the point the point is what science does for us .
after puberty , we fall off the map .
durable , engineered , permanent those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral .
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
most patients can not afford to be treated on time , and they die .
it shifted the earth s tectonic plates , sped up the planet s rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .
i would love for them to be able to just print out a foldscope and carry them around in their pockets .
it s easy to ask questions about how did life begin , or what extends beyond the universe , but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space .
it was the editors choice in science , which is a top science magazine .
so how do we actually ask them the question
the differences were dramatic .
bl right so we ve got our observations . we ve got our data .
so when you put four .
applause
he was saying , are we clear on what we just accepted
next year , we re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , .
they kept it close to them .
god damn it , kyle . all right , hahaha . i hit em .
the instant gratification monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel .
if you do n t see a problem , then i d better leave , and stop talking in vain .
this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .
our experiences of love are both biological and cultural .
and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time
so half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and did n t like the broccoli just like a baby and any other sane person .
well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
applause
so to us , this work also presents its own contradiction .
oh .
now , it does n t have to be that way . there is hope .
let me explain by giving you this analogy .
you know , i think it s probably millions .
sometimes , you know , it snows as late as may , but summer always comes eventually . fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized , lonely place .
i was clearly more nervous than he was .
amy o toole thank you , beau . we thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think , because we look alike .
so let me just mount some drives . go over there .
i told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work .
applause
what you do is , you take it on , and just like you are playing like a toy , which it is , i tab it off , and i break it off .
whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
and how long has it been going on and what does it mean
their brains on average , by the end , were bigger than yours and mine in this room today .
but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .
human contracted itself blind , malignant .
i was sitting on a bed in a hostel in south america , and i was watching the person i love walk out the door .
by now , i had the whole frenzied repertoire terrifying voices , grotesque visions , bizarre , intractable delusions .
it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
any one of you , anybody does n t matter if you re rich , if you re poor , if you have a fancy house does n t matter .
and the remarkable thing was that month old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so i ve asked amy to be the last voice in this short story .
at the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
applause
ultimately , each experience of love is different .
neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all .
so i grew up in limpopo , on the border of limpopo and mpumalanga , a little town called motetema .
as you can see , the device enters the body through the natural channels .
the disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year . the shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma , all you have to do is wash your face no medicine , no pills , no injections .
and let s put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let s get started .
over two million people became refugees .
ag okay , hypothesis two .
hi . i am an architect .
tens hundreds thousands
even when he wrote in english , when you read his writings in english , you smell the same smell , sense the same feeling .
nothing personal .
last year , it was the second most downloaded paper by biology letters , and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well .
so what s really interesting about this object , and my students hate when i do this , but i m going to do this anyway , is these are rugged devices .
in the last years , the hearing voices movement has established hearing voices networks in countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity , solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress , to create a new language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual .
back in , you d have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour .
i also think it s interesting that there s been less coverage of this issue in the united states .
nearly , people were killed , and the city like this nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
that s actually what an experiment is .
as long as it comes from our hearts , we can write about anything and everything .
well , what s it like to be this kind of creature
and it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions . the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty .
they include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence .
tracy s temp job was a tryout , just like an internship , and it ended up being a win for both tracy and her employer .
now here s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
in that moment in time , mandela told the world s press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country that post apartheid rainbow nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children .
where can i use it , then we could all ask this question !
you re times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
music this is not . . . laughter
well , that s what goes on in our country .
i really like this way of thinking about love .
so i proposed to the mayor while i was making partitions .
and the other thing there s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
i experienced this , not so much as a geographical shift , as a linguistic one .
the reason because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight , and there was trading contact across that straight throughout , years .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
these are the kind of things that go on .
so we had to create one .
you ca n t patent products of nature the air , the water , minerals , elements of the periodic table .
and he said , oh god , are you crazy
and her baby will receive pmtct , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .
i was an unlikely person to be doing this .
what is our intellect
so , i said , look , derek well , first of all , the guy ca n t just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain i said , look , derek , take it home and practice with it for a week or two .
now , my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers .
i knew something about genetics , but i was n t even a lawyer , let alone a patent lawyer .
researchers believe that the low levels of serotonin is correlated with obsessive thinking about the object of love , which is like this feeling that someone has set up camp in your brain .
they teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring .
when did this happen we do n t know , but it s possible that neanderthals did n t do this .
on the one hand was my mother , a well educated , secular , modern , westernized , turkish woman .
it s the relauncher s responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value .
one of the things we learned was that poor communities do n t buy products in bulk .
on the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
there was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .
it s just really about combining different realities .
and the question is , in this situation , with the monkey behind the wheel , how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pleasant place , but where really important things happen
the question you might ask though is why do children learn so much
the first step was to ask a question .
since then , they publish every year .
all we need is a playing card . any card will do .
anyone who s a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog .
now , uncertainty is a very bad thing . it s evolutionarily a bad thing . if you re not sure that s a predator , it s too late .
if i showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
i have read blackawton bees recently . i do n t have words to explain exactly how i am feeling right now .
bl can you help me , henry what good scientist says that , right
there is a code , a color code embedded , that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope .
in other words , you need to understand how ideas have sex .
make a wish . blowing noise voice do n t tell , or it wo n t come true .
but what i think comes next is far more interesting .
thank you very much .
how did we become the only species that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous
awful things will happen in this century , i m absolutely sure .
so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
huh . hang on a moment .
as six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of ted decided to release the speakers .
now in closing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
everybody could go and listen , you know ordinary people , even the sultan , muslims and non muslims .
and when someone talks to me that way , i hate the arabic language .
i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
and the average facebook user is creating pieces of content each month .
their resilience and courage inspire our creativity .
if we were to kill the language , we d have to find an identity .
it s like being in love in paris for the first time after you ve had three double espressos .
it s still hard .
it could bring the arabic language back to being number one .
by the end of this year , there ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
bl all right . one , two , three . laughter if you were portuguese , right how about this one one , two , three .
the group discussed , how do we measure quality today
the queen does it all .
i think that s fair to say , it s almost everyone in the hall .
this particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
and the answer is about half a second .
when we started doing our research at bcg , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
so i think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they re revising to figure out how the world works .
the differences are what interest me , because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago .
it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .
language is n t just for conversing , just words coming out of our mouths .
applause
it s the interchange of ideas , the meeting and mating of ideas between them , that is causing technological progress , incrementally , bit by bit .
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right
the cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways .
even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
this story is about taking imagination seriously .
so i proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only u . s . dollars per unit .
so it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
as you know , one leg of the compass is static , rooted in a place .
you compare hospitals in a country , you ll find some that are extremely good , but you ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
applause
i think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .
and adults attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
they make it sacred .
and i want to leave you with this picture .
think about how far we have come .
they know .
how hard could it be to walk up the stairs
but we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , that we have a duty to be part of that solution .
photography is about empathy , and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy .
and i was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness .
many obstacles arise all the time .
where is she
all right which means , when it comes to perception , we re all like this frog .
your brain can not deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
this is beyond just missing our chance of being modern and civilized .
so going the hospital is a lottery .
the problem lies with the microscope itself .
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
one of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when i checked into a deli at a restaurant in new york on foursquare .
it does n t ring a bell , does it
i mean , our brief it was pretty good , but not this good .
we did n t want to change this , because this is the standard that s been optimized for over the years , and many health workers are actually used to this .
people tell you this one thing will make your life complete .
we call that poverty these days .
i returned from germany to bolivia , thinking that wherever we go , we have the opportunity to make a difference .
i write the blog wait but why .
it does n t work .
so , i talk to you from the east , but you reply from the west has hit the spot .
so i looked at the waiter and said , do you have a menu arabic
what cristine did was use our blicket detectors .
so amy , would you please come up applause applause so amy s going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project , and first she s going to tell you the question that they came up with . so go ahead , amy .
well , that s simple .
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
we really should n t kill our language .
applause .
the limpopo sun gets really hot in winter .
and she does n t have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog .
it was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there years because people loved it .
laughter applause that did not happen . laughter
and here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year old baby .
even more remarkably though , the fact that month olds did n t do this suggests that these month olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were months old .
so , in order for them to innovate and produce , they had to protect their language .
